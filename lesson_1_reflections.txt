1. using diff to compare docs:

marks the difference between 2 files

a + indicates something new added
a - indicates something removed

Diff does not show the point of difference, only the line where things are different

2.Having history of a file:

help you compare working versions with broken ones. 

allow you to make big changes without having to worry about losing your work.

Allow others to collaborate and being able to identify new mistakes.

3. manual commits in version control

Human error can result in a loss of work (if you dont save)

however you can point to important changes with your version history

4. why save multiple files with eacg commit

since some changes in code functionality require modification of multiple files in order to work, it makes sense to look accross file types at the same time.

5.Using log and diff to see the history of files

Git log shows the history of changes (by using git log --stat you can see how much has changed)
 diff allows you to compare 2 files togther and see what has changed line by line.

 6. using version control to track changes

allows you to go back and find bugs from previous commits.
