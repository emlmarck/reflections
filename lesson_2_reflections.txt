1.git init command

Initializing a repository creates a .git file that keeps track of files in repository.

You need to do it in order to track files 

2. The staging area 

The staging area is different from  a WD and the repo because it locks in the files in place. 

In order to use the staging area to make only one logical change you can use the "git diff" and "git --staged" commands to look at exactly what you changed and decide what to commit when.

3. The power of branches

With a branch you can implement experimental changes on a project without disrupting a working version. 

Branches would be helpful when multiple people are working on the same project so that each developes thier own version.

4. diagrams

diagrams help you see the entire branch structure of the repository. 

Therefore you can see where you are and if there are anychanges that will not be included in the branch structure ie unreachable commits.

5. mergeing

allows work done separately into one master

6. Automatic vs manual merging

automatic merging helps when things are actually different... saves lots of busy work

manual merging helps when the conflicts are subtle etc...
