1.git init command

Initializing a repository creates a .git file that keeps track of files in repository.

You need to do it in order to track files 

2. The staging area 

The staging area is different from  a WD and the repo because it locks in the files in place. 

In order to use the staging area to make only one logical change you can use the "git diff" and "git --staged" commands to look at exactly what you changed and decide what to commit when.
